In this project, we employed a comprehensive data analysis approach to enhance the IT service desk operations at the University of Miami. Using a blend of software tools like Tableau for data visualization, R for logistic binary regression, and SPSS for statistical analysis, we meticulously examined survey data to pinpoint dissatisfaction drivers among service users. Our analysis led to the development of a Tableau dashboard, now actively used by the university, providing dynamic insights into service performance metrics. The logistic binary regression models helped us understand the impact of various service aspects on user satisfaction. We delivered a full analytical report, a summarizing presentation, and a set of data-driven recommendations for process improvement, aiming to optimize response times and enhance overall service efficiency at the IT desk. This strategic approach not only streamlined operations but also significantly boosted process efficiency and customer satisfaction.
