In this project, we tackled a real-world problem faced by farmers—optimizing land allocation for planting wheat, corn, and sugar beets to maximize profitability under the unpredictable influence of weather conditions. To address this, we developed a Stochastic Linear Programming model that captures the uncertainties in crop yields due to varying environmental factors.

Our approach involved generating diverse scenarios representing potential changes in weather patterns, which directly affect crop yields. These scenarios ranged from optimal to less favorable conditions, altering yields by ±20% and more, to simulate real-world fluctuations. This technique allowed us to robustly test our models against a spectrum of possible agricultural outcomes.

We crafted this model using three computational techniques: a hand-coded simplex method, a Primal Affine Scaling Interior Point Method, and a commercial-grade linear programming solver, each evaluated for their efficiency and accuracy in handling the stochastic elements. The essence of our model was to protect farmers against risks posed by weather variability by providing a strategy that adjusts to multiple scenarios.

The constraints of our model were designed to ensure that the production meets at least the minimum required amounts, factoring in the purchase of additional crops from the market if internal production fell short. This realistic constraint setup reflects actual agricultural practices and the need for flexibility in planning.

By implementing and comparing these methods, we discovered that the simplex method and the commercial solver typically delivered faster and more reliable outcomes. In contrast, the affine scaling method, although simpler to implement, exhibited limitations in handling increased scenario complexity. Our analysis underscored significant variances in computational speed and solution precision between the methods, demonstrating the power of advanced mathematical models to effectively address and solve stochastic optimization problems. These results underscore the importance of choosing the right algorithm to manage complex dependencies and variabilities within large datasets.

In conclusion, this project not only advances our understanding of stochastic programming in an agricultural context but also provides a practical framework for farmers to make informed, resilient planting decisions in the face of environmental uncertainties.
